## Mailing list

We have a [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/discussions/) forum to discuss usage and development of OpenBLAS. We also have a [Google group for *users*](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-users) and a [Google group for *development of*](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-dev) OpenBLAS. 

## Donations

You can read OpenBLAS statement of receipts and disbursement and cash balance on [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AghkTjXe2lDndE1UZml0dGpaUzJmZGhvenBZd1F2R1E&usp=sharing). A backer list is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/BACKERS.md).

We welcome the hardware donation, including the latest CPU and boards.
